# Deferred findings

Defects, shortcuts and debt a card **found but did not own**. Recorded so they are neither
lost nor silently absorbed into an unrelated card. Nothing here authorizes a code change.

**Process.** Workers **report findings to the orchestrator**; workers do **not** edit this
shared file. Findings accumulate across a pack, and this file is updated **once at pack
closeout** — not after every card.

**Entry format.** ID · severity · discovering card · exact path/symbol · observed vs
expected · minimal reproducer or evidence · current-card impact · future owner or
`unowned` · shortcut deliberately accepted, where applicable.

## F-001 — evidence-haystack ordering is not mutation-pinned

- **Severity** low
- **Discovered by** H-008
- **Path/symbol** `src/t2pw/rag/graph_delta.py` — the sorted evidence-haystack ordering
- **Observed vs expected** The sorted ordering is implemented, but nothing pins it, so a
  mutation that reorders the haystack would not be caught.
- **Evidence** No test asserts the sort order; H-008's tests exercise retention, not order.
- **Current-card impact** none
- **Owner** `unowned`
- **Escalation** Blocking only if a later card (C-043) exposes an actual deterministic
  correctness failure. **C-043 merged at `3c04d4b` without exposing one.**

## F-002 — comment overstates scalar writer coverage

- **Severity** low · documentation only
- **Discovered by** H-008
- **Path/symbol** `src/t2pw/rag/graph_delta.py:99-100`
- **Observed vs expected** The comment claims wider scalar writer coverage than the code
  implements.
- **Evidence** the two cited lines
- **Current-card impact** none
- **Owner** `unowned`

## F-003 — a worktree pytest run silently tests the PRIMARY checkout

- **Severity** **HIGH** · infrastructure · affects every future card
- **Discovered by** C-043, corroborated independently by C-030, C-038 and four reviewers
- **Path/symbol** `.venv/Lib/site-packages/__editable__.t2pw-0.1.0.pth` · `pytest.ini` ·
  absence of any `conftest.py`
- **Observed vs expected** The editable `.pth` hard-codes
  `C:\Users\Angad\Desktop\SummerBIOIN\Project14-T2PW\src`; `pytest.ini` sets **no**
  `pythonpath`; there is **no `conftest.py` anywhere in the repo**. A pytest run launched from
  a worktree **without** `PYTHONPATH` imports `t2pw` from the **primary** checkout. A card that
  adds a new module fails loudly on `ImportError`; **a card that modifies existing files fails
  silently** — its tests pass against unmodified primary code and prove nothing.
- **Evidence** `cd .claude/worktrees/<any>; python -m pytest tests/<worktree-only-test>.py` →
  `ImportError: cannot import name 'controller' from 't2pw.rag'
  (C:\...\Project14-T2PW\src\t2pw\rag\__init__.py)`. C-038's reviewer additionally measured the
  primary checkout's `pipeline.py` blob as **identical to `e4eeef4`**, i.e. an unpinned run
  silently tests an earlier base.
- **Aggravating factor** `tests/test_completeness_audit.py` is **inside the pinned smoke gate**
  and performs no `sys.path.insert`, importing `t2pw` directly at `:13`. It is 10th in the smoke
  list, so **smoke's correctness currently rests on test-file ordering.**
- **Current-card impact** none — every Pack 1 writer and reviewer pinned `PYTHONPATH` and
  certified `t2pw.__file__` **inside the pytest process**. All merge gates were run from the
  primary checkout with the merge staged, so they resolve correctly by construction.
- **Owner** `unowned` — a one-line `pythonpath = src` in `pytest.ini`, or a `conftest.py`,
  closes the entire class. Outside every Pack 1 card's manifest.

## F-004 — G11 reports record no environment

- **Severity** medium · evidence integrity
- **Discovered by** C-043 / C-032 / C-035 reviewers
- **Path/symbol** `docs/pwml_recovery_sprint/evidence/bounded_run.py` report schema
- **Observed vs expected** The report captures `cwd` and `command` verbatim but **not the
  environment**, so a `PYTHONPATH` pinning claim is not self-evidencing from the artifact.
  Reviewers had to re-derive every pinning claim independently.
- **Current-card impact** none — reviewers re-derived
- **Owner** `unowned`. Recording resolved `sys.path[0]` would make F-003 auditable from the
  record. `bounded_run.py` is protected; needs an explicit ownership grant.

## F-005 — chunk E tripwire will fire on the next committed run directory

- **Severity** **HIGH** · forward-dated
- **Discovered by** C-031 reviewer
- **Path/symbol** `tests/test_strict_quarantine_real_artifact_replay.py:581
  test_no_unlisted_artifact_quietly_carries_stage_zero_context`
- **Observed vs expected** The test fails any `*.json` under `runs/` that is on neither
  `_PAYLOAD_FILENAMES` nor `_STAGE_ZERO_DIAGNOSTIC_FILENAMES`, is ≤ 2,000,000 B, and contains
  `key_compounds`. Measured against a production-shaped `pathway_context`,
  **`quarantine_report.json` and `coverage_summary.json` both contain `key_compounds`.**
- **Evidence** Chunk E is green today — 0 unlisted marker-carriers across the 321 committed
  `runs/` JSON files, re-verified at C-031's merge — **because C-031 commits no run directory.**
- **Current-card impact** none
- **Owner** whoever commits the **first real run directory after `cbf30f6`**. Fix per the test's
  own message: classify both filenames into `_STAGE_ZERO_DIAGNOSTIC_FILENAMES` with a reason.

## F-006 — D-002 is not satisfied end-to-end on the production path

- **Severity** **MEDIUM** · no owner exists
- **Discovered by** C-041, confirmed by its reviewer
- **Path/symbol** `src/t2pw/pipeline/strict_quarantine.py:1959`
- **Observed vs expected** `not coverage.get("minimum_core_satisfied")` still becomes a
  `refusal_reason`, so **PMC12096016 at 0.167 coverage is still blocked** rather than exported as
  `review_required` PWML. D-002 requires the threshold to block release-ready status, **not PWML
  production**.
- **Evidence** C-041 supplies the classification that says otherwise; the blocking site is
  outside its ownership.
- **Current-card impact** none — C-041 delivered its chartered contract
- **Owner** **none.** `MASTER_PLAN` §9's C-041 ownership row and the dispatch instruction both
  exclude `quarantine_and_close`; only `:230`'s prose rationale assumed otherwise. Editing it
  would have been an `out_of_boundary` REJECT. **Needs a product-owner ruling on which card
  closes it.**

## F-007 — `_apply_single_op` aliases the caller's patch ops

- **Severity** **MEDIUM**
- **Discovered by** C-036 writer, quantified by its reviewer
- **Path/symbol** `src/t2pw/curation/apply_audit_patch.py :: _apply_single_op`
- **Observed vs expected** `op["value"]` is installed **without copying**, so C-036's
  `_record_audit_lineage` writes *through* into the caller's patch ops.
- **Evidence** A genuine rollback yields `rolled_back: True`, `applied_count: 0`, returned
  payload clean — but **`caller PATCH OPS mutated: True`**, and the persisted
  `rejected_patch_log.json` then contains, inside a `"rolled_back": true` entry, a lineage
  record reading *"an accepted audit patch 'add' operation produced this row's content"* for
  content that **never committed**. Separately,
  `tests/test_apply_audit_patch_lock_policy.py:160` passes **only** because both sides are the
  same object — a latent third failure for whoever fixes the aliasing.
- **Current-card impact** none — no payload row is falsely attributed
- **Owner** `unowned`. The only in-boundary fix is copying in `_apply_single_op`, which is a
  behaviour change outside "lineage writes only".

## F-008 — A0-C7 remains open; the freeze seam is incomplete

- **Severity** **MEDIUM**
- **Discovered by** C-030 rev1, proven by C-030 rev2 and its reviewer
- **Path/symbol** `src/t2pw/app/streamlit_app.py` — at base `e4eeef4`, lines **`:3658`,
  `:3668`, `:3710`, `:3713`** inside `run_post_pipeline_sbml_artifacts`
- **Observed vs expected** A0-C7 is bound to C-030, but is **undischargeable inside
  `freeze_canonical_payload`**: the seam's canonical payload is a `deepcopy` that **nothing in
  the returned dict aliases**, so there is no sharing inside the boundary to break.
- **Evidence** The documented share→copy mutant is indistinguishable from the tip on **all nine
  seam observables across all 39 legs**. The four real sharing sites are C-052's symbol.
- **Current-card impact** C-030 merged with A0-C7 **descoped, not re-bound**. Per `LEDGER.md`,
  *"a seam is not complete while its row is open"* — **the freeze seam is recorded incomplete
  pending C-052.**
- **Owner** **C-052**
- **Shortcut accepted** Deliberately. No vacuous assertion was written in its place.

## F-009 — SBML carries no taxonomy annotation, so T-102's organism axis may be unreachable

- **Severity** **MEDIUM** · needs a product decision
- **Discovered by** C-045 planning
- **Path/symbol** `src/t2pw/sbml/` (all 7 modules) · `pipeline/canonical.py:624-626`
- **Observed vs expected** `src/t2pw/sbml/` contains **zero** occurrences of `taxonom`. C-020's
  comparator calls the absence *"a real loss to REPORT"*, and a `taxonomy_ids` mismatch is a
  `Difference` → verdict `not_equivalent`.
- **Consequence** **T-102's organism axis appears unreachable however completely C-045
  succeeds**, and the sprint-wide SBML prohibition bars any card from adding the annotation.
- **Current-card impact** none — C-045 is planning-only and undispatched
- **Owner** **product owner.** Related: species are not an entity kind in C-020's `_KINDS`
  projection (`canonical.py:226`), so T-102 cannot detect a species `pathwhiz_id` fabrication
  via the comparator — that must be checked against the graph-hash projection (A0-C1).

## F-010 — `ir.py :: _component_record` is the actual cause of the `mapping_meta` loss

- **Severity** **MEDIUM**
- **Discovered by** C-045 planning
- **Path/symbol** `src/t2pw/pwml/ir.py :: _component_record` (`:414-434`)
- **Observed vs expected** It never calls `_copy_common_entity_fields`, and is the real cause of
  the measured `mapping_meta` / `taxonomy_backfill` loss recorded in `MASTER_PLAN` §1.2 — **not**
  `_canonicalize_species_offline`, to which the loss had been attributed.
- **Current-card impact** none
- **Owner** **none.** Owned by no card and named in no control-plane document.

## F-011 — the identity ladder is now duplicated across two modules

- **Severity** **MEDIUM**
- **Discovered by** C-030 reviewer
- **Path/symbol** `src/t2pw/pwml/compound_resolution.py` (`:101`, `:122`, `:213`, `:356`) vs
  `src/t2pw/pwml/ir.py`
- **Observed vs expected** C-040 copied `_first_nonempty`, `_db_id` and the compound key lists
  into the new module. C-030's `graph_projection` **mirrors** the ordered key lists that now live
  in two places, and its census oracle reads **only** `ir.py`'s copy.
- **Evidence** Verified byte-identical at merge time. A later divergence in the compound path
  would not be caught by C-030's allowlist-completeness test.
- **Current-card impact** none
- **Owner** `unowned`. Closing it properly would mean importing `ir.py` into `canonical_hash.py`,
  inverting the exporter/hash dependency C-030 exists to protect.

## F-012 — `bench/semantic.py :: _check_rag_reintroduction` is defective in both directions

- **Severity** **MEDIUM**
- **Discovered by** R-004, with the fail-open direction found independently by R-003
- **Path/symbol** `src/t2pw/bench/semantic.py:936-987` and its `_claim_key` at `:921-933`
- **Observed vs expected** `_claim_key` omits `gap_id`, while the admission gate's decision unit
  is `RagReactionCandidate.merge_key() = (gap_id, claim_identity())`
  (`src/t2pw/rag/admission.py:1524-1525`). It also indexes **only** `admission["rejected"]`,
  never `accepted`, and was built from **200 of 837** rejected rows (`truncated.rejected = 637`).
- **Evidence** **False positive:** all three PMC12657337/research "reintroduced" reactions were
  in fact **ACCEPTED** under the exact `gap_id`s the exported rows carry; re-running the check's
  own `_claim_key` gives 5 accepted keys, 10 rejected keys, **overlap 5 of 5** — the check cannot
  pass on that leg while any RAG reaction survives. **Fail-open:** the same check returned
  `ok=true` for PMC12180156/strict against 14 of 239 rejected claims while a rejected span sat in
  the payload **3× verbatim**.
- **Current-card impact** none — outside every Pack 1 boundary
- **Owner** `unowned`. R-004 proposes a new card **C-062**. **Do not read this check's output as
  ground truth about the gate.**

## F-013 — `ReleaseStatus` has no `__post_init__`, so TRAP-1 lives only in the factory

- **Severity** **MEDIUM**
- **Discovered by** C-041 reviewer
- **Path/symbol** `src/t2pw/pipeline/release_status.py:182-203`
- **Observed vs expected** The invariant `strict_acceptance_eligible == (status ==
  release_ready)` is enforced at the single construction site inside `classify_release_status`,
  but `ReleaseStatus` is a public frozen dataclass with **no** `__post_init__`.
- **Evidence** Both `ReleaseStatus(status=REVIEW_REQUIRED, …, strict_acceptance_eligible=True)`
  and `dataclasses.replace(good, status=REVIEW_REQUIRED)` produce a strict-eligible
  `review_required`. Nothing does this today. TRAP-1 was independently verified to hold across
  **528** input combinations through the factory.
- **Current-card impact** none
- **Owner** **C-053 / C-054 / C-056b**, which build directly on this type.

## F-014 — the ledger's A0-C1 census figure does not reproduce

- **Severity** **MEDIUM** · control plane · **corrected by this pack**
- **Discovered by** C-030 rev1, re-derived independently by C-030 rev2 and its reviewer
- **Path/symbol** `LEDGER.md` § Carried Wave A0 requirements — A0-C1's *"60 committed rows"*
- **Observed vs expected** Three independent censuses over all 32 committed `final_mapped.json`
  measure **49** gap rows, not 60 — compounds 38, protein_complexes 11; keys
  `pathbank_compound_id` 38, `pathbank_complex_id` 11; **all at tier 4** (`candidates[0]`), 0 at
  tier 2, 0 at tier 1/3 on a non-allowlisted key; 19 distinct files.
- **Evidence** Corpus drift excluded: `git log 09fb40d..e4eeef4 -- '*final_mapped.json'` is empty
  and the corpus is 32 files at both SHAs. The nearest 60 in the corpus is the **file count of
  `merged_payload.json`**, the most plausible transcription source.
- **Current-card impact** C-030 discharged A0-C1 against **all 49** measured rows.
- **Owner** product owner, to ratify the figure in `LEDGER.md`.

## F-015 — orchestrator budget sizing was wrong on three of twelve cards

- **Severity** medium · process
- **Discovered by** the Lead Orchestrator, against itself
- **Observed vs expected** C-030 750→1200, C-033 850→1300, C-032 950→1100. **Every one** was a
  card whose specification is a **multi-clause locked decision** — A0-C1's census plus mutation
  proofs; D-003's eight clauses; D-005's ~ten clauses. All three were caught by **writers
  stopping**, not by review.
- **Rule for future charters** Size the acceptance work **per clause**; do not anchor on a peer
  card's total. Measured test-to-production ratios in this pack ran 0.57–1.07.
- **Owner** the orchestrator

## F-016 — C-037's worktree was created but no writer was dispatched

- **Severity** low · process
- **Discovered by** the Lead Orchestrator, against itself
- **Observed vs expected** In the batch that wrote the shared C-035/036/037 charter and created
  all three worktrees, only **two** writers were launched. C-037's branch sat clean at base for
  most of the pack and was dispatched late.
- **Rule** Verify every worktree created has a corresponding writer before moving on.
- **Owner** the orchestrator

## Low / editorial — recorded, not itemised

| # | Path/symbol | What |
|---|---|---|
| F-017 | `TEST_MATRIX.md` chunk table | Chunk A row says **123**; measured **126** at base and tip across four cards |
| F-018 | `tests/test_*lineage*`, `test_gap_resolver*`, `test_apply_audit_patch_*`, `test_stage_one_boundary`, `test_early_failure_replay` | None appears in any `TEST_MATRIX` chunk, so the assigned chunk exercises none of the lineage-writer seams. Mitigated at charter level by naming each seam's files explicitly. **Do not fix by adding files to a chunk** — that moves the pinned 460 baseline |
| F-019 | `src/t2pw/rag/provenance.py:274` | `strip_provenance` docstring says "provenance-free deep copy"; it leaves `provenance_lineage`. Ruled **not a defect** — zero production callers, and the residual entry names its own source, so it is self-supporting. A `strip_provenance` that removed lineage would re-open F-003's class |
| F-020 | `deadline.py:361`, `:550`, `runner.py:926` | Three docstrings now understate override recording ("claims no override", "the unmodified ceiling"). Correcting in place costs +6 and would breach C-032's 1100 ceiling. Doc-only pass |
| F-021 | `evidence/bounded_run.py:15-16` | Header still records that `runner.py` has "no `finally`" — stale since C-032 |
| F-022 | `pipeline.py :: _carry_rag_provenance` | Now carries lineage too, so the name is inaccurate. Renaming needs `_clean_processes`'s four call sites, owned by no card |
| F-023 | `gap_resolver.py:3269` | `report["actions"][-1]["row"]` aliases the payload row, so `gap_resolution_report.json` echoes lineage. Pre-existing on both sides; one attribution, not two |
| F-024 | `LineageSource.source_id` (placements) | Carries a compartment name rather than a record identifier; a consumer aggregating on `source_id` will see compartment names mixed with accessions |
| F-025 | `src/t2pw/rag/ingest.py:174-177` | `rag_provenance.chunk_id` is positional, not content-derived — id `8610ceaf…` appears in **both** PMC12657337 and PMC12421875 over different text |
| F-026 | `synthesize.py:1311 _build_entities` | Synthesis still erases inbound lineage on **entity** rows (rebuilt as `{"name": display}`). Same F-004 shape as the carrier hole, left open in the same owned function. Not shipping-critical: the production merge path retains the base payload's own entity row |
| F-027 | `controller.py:289` | `RoundAborted` reconstructs from the pre-round checkpoint, so an aborted round's **observations** are dropped and a resumed loop re-offers those claims as novel. Highest of C-043's deferred set; belongs in **C-055's** brief |
| F-028 | `pipeline.py:1873` | `evidence` is deliberately excluded from `_RAG_ROW_CARRIER_KEYS`, so a RAG row's evidence span is not carried; R-003's F7 attribution required a verbatim join |
| F-029 | `map_ids.py:7647 map_payload` | C-033 lands effectively unwired: the only reachable production path is the `T2PW_IDENTITY_EVIDENCE` env switch, which builds a source with **no PathBank resolver**, leaving D-003 step 2 reachable only by programmatic install |
| F-030 | `map_ids.py:5548-5563` | `meta["rejected_mapped_ids"]` is still written on the `unavailable` path, co-existing with the honest preserved claim |
| F-031 | `MASTER_PLAN.md:336` | Lists `src/t2pw/rag/extract.py` as a decoy; it is **live**, reached via a multi-line tuple import at `streamlit_app.py:454` and used at `:645` in `maybe_run_rag` |
| F-032 | `MASTER_PLAN.md:363` | Assigns `rag/admission.py` to C-035 (lineage writes), but a future **C-061** needs behavioural changes to `parse_span_relation` and `validate_evidence_span` in the same file. C-035 merged with both **byte-identical** to keep them free; the §9 row still needs fixing before C-061 is dispatched |
| F-033 | H-009 commit `90b9da9` | Subject carries a stray leading `@` from PowerShell here-string syntax used in the Bash tool. Amending is forbidden; the merge commit is authoritative for integration history |
| F-034 | `src/t2pw/extraction/extract.py` | Dead demo code — 29 lines, one hardcoded glutathione paragraph, `run_demo()` under `__main__`, zero test references, imported only by the `src/extract.py` re-export shim. C-034's declared target |
| F-035 | `bench/metrics.BLOCKER_SCOPE_LABELS` | Produces a 125-column line in `render._blockers`, over that module's own 100-column budget. Pre-existing |
| F-036 | `driver.py :: RunOutcome` | C-041 and C-032 both attach classification as **undeclared instance attributes** to keep the golden diff empty. Sound and documented, but dataclass `__eq__`/`__repr__` ignore them, and `getattr` is required on every read. Must not survive past C-053, which owns the row |
