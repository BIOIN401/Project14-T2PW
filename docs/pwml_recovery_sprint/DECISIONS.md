# PWML Recovery Sprint — Decisions

Append-only. Product-owner decisions only. Agents read; they never write here.

## D-001 — Lineage and payload hashing · 2026-08-05 · LOCKED

Two versioned hashes, not one, and not an exclusion.

- `canonical_graph_sha256` — biological content only: entities, identifiers, reactions,
  roles, stoichiometry, directionality, complexes, locations, references.
- `canonical_payload_sha256` — the complete saved `final_mapped.json`, including lineage,
  evidence, confidence and provenance.

Exporters bind to the graph hash. Persisted-artifact integrity binds to the payload hash.

Both are **versioned canonical projections that exclude all hash and stamp fields from
their own input** — a hash is never an input to itself. The graph projection is an
allowlist, never a denylist.

Lineage must not change graph equivalence; lineage changes must remain detectable.

Historical hashes keep their existing meaning. Add `hash_schema_version` rather than
silently changing what `payload_sha256` means.

**Implements:** C-013.

## D-002 — Coverage below minimum · 2026-08-05 · LOCKED

`requested_core_coverage_below_minimum` triggers targeted retrieval **before**
classification. It is not, in itself, a refusal.

After bounded RAG is exhausted: a biologically correct, internally connected fragment
that is representable without guessing → `review_required` PWML. Not `release_ready`. Not
strict benchmark success. Record completeness, missing anchors, retrieval attempts, and
why further supported expansion failed.

`diagnostic_only` is reserved for cases with no defensible connected core, or where
serialization would require invention.

The threshold blocks release-ready status, not PWML production. **The threshold value
does not move.**

**Reference case:** PMC12096016 at 0.167 coverage after the C-010 fix.
**Implements:** C-041, C-055.

## D-003 — UniProt in the identity ladder · 2026-08-05 · LOCKED

Approved as a **bounded, cached, pre-freeze evidence source**. Not a hidden live
dependency inside PWML export.

Flow: accession already on the entity → PathBank by exact identifier → UniProt by exact
accession if PathBank evidence is inadequate → cache and persist the record with response
provenance → immutable `identity_evidence_candidate` → existing species, name/gene, score
and conflict checks **unchanged** → materialize in `final_mapped.json`. Exporters perform
no network or database lookups.

Failure semantics: network failure is not evidence that an accession is false. Preserve
the submitted accession as an unverified claim; do not promote it; do not erase it.
Record `verification_status: unavailable` or `not_evaluated`, distinct from `rejected`.
Degrade the export identity to a placeholder if a verified identity is essential and
unavailable.

UniProt must not be required to re-export saved canonical JSON.

**Implements:** C-033.
**Note:** `_fetch_uniprot_enrichment` (`enrich_entities.py:507`) and `EnrichmentCache`
already provide the fetch and the cache. C-033 relocates them to the ladder; it does not
build them.

## D-004 — `review_required` artifact naming · 2026-08-05 · LOCKED

- `pathway.pwml` — `release_ready` only
- `pathway.review_required.pwml` — valid but requiring biological review
- no final PWML for `diagnostic_only`, unless a separately named diagnostic draft is
  genuinely useful

Manifest records structured status independently:

```json
{
  "pipeline_status": "pass",
  "release_status": "review_required",
  "pwml_artifact": "pathway.review_required.pwml",
  "strict_acceptance_eligible": true,
  "strict_acceptance_passed": false,
  "completeness": 0.167
}
```

Artifact classification will eventually depend on structured status rather than filename.
Distinct names are the safe migration while existing code still equates `pathway.pwml`
with strict success — four independent sites do so today (`runner.py:116`, `:856`;
`driver.py:1319`, `:2008`; `acceptance.py:88`, `:497`).

Scope: **batch artifact set only.** The interactive download and `outputs/` are unchanged.

**Implements:** C-053.

## D-005 — Timeout budget and extraction escalation · 2026-08-05 · LOCKED

`leg_timeout_seconds` default **3600 s**; 120 s parent/child grace preserved → child
deadline **3480 s**. Per-leg overrides must be explicit and recorded in the run manifest;
no silent extension of difficult benchmark legs.

One monotonic per-leg deadline across all stages, recording elapsed and remaining budget.
No LLM call starts unless its configured maximum duration plus the downstream
finalization reserve fits the remaining budget. The reserve is configurable and eventually
calibrated from recorded stage runtimes; it covers checkpoint persistence, validation,
status classification and diagnostic-artifact writing. Checkpoint before any potentially
long LLM or retrieval call.

Stage-1 extraction: **at most three total attempts including the first.** If attempts 1
and 2 return the same empty response hash, never issue the same prompt to the same model
a third time — that strategy has demonstrated it is inert. Spend the remaining budget on
a genuinely different recovery mechanism.

The attempt cap is a safety ceiling, not a promise. Insufficient budget for the next rung
→ stop, record `budget_exhausted`.

Six termination reasons, never conflated: `retrieval_exhausted` · `no_new_claims` ·
`budget_exhausted` · `operation_timeout` · `identical_empty_response` ·
`scientifically_unrecoverable`.

Denominators: `budget_exhausted` is an operational failure in pipeline-completion and
end-to-end strict-success metrics; never relabelled semantic failure, scientific
insufficiency, or retrieval exhaustion. `retrieval_exhausted` may be claimed only when
the configured ladder actually completed.

**Order is mandatory:** budget/checkpoint infrastructure (C-032) **before** the escalation
ladder (C-042). Do not implement a fixed number of unconditional retries.

**Blocked by:** `OpenAI(...)` currently has no `timeout=`; worst-case one `chat_detailed`
≈ 4871 s against a 3480 s deadline. C-014 must land first.

## D-006 — Semantic evaluation reaches runtime · 2026-08-05 · LOCKED

Semantic checks must affect the actual runtime `release_status`. Wiring them only into
benchmark denominators is insufficient.

C-056a (runtime) precedes C-056b (benchmark denominators).

The pipeline must distinguish, without collapsing any into another: pipeline execution
succeeded · strict technical gates passed · semantic evaluation passed · semantic
evaluation failed · semantic evaluation **was not performed**.

---

## D-007 — Biological equivalence is proven by parsing · 2026-08-05 · LOCKED

Test equivalence by parsing and normalizing the JSON, PWML and SBML graphs and comparing
the dimensions in `PRODUCT_CONTRACT.md` §5.

Comparing the same JSON hash twice proves nothing and is not acceptable evidence.

**Implements:** C-020, verified at T-102.

---

## D-008 — RAG rounds must re-enter the pipeline · 2026-08-05 · LOCKED

Every RAG round must re-enter normalization, mapping, gates, persistence and
classification. A round that retrieves and merges without re-entering all five is a
failure regardless of what it retrieved.

C-055 therefore depends on C-032 (deadline/checkpoint infrastructure) in addition to
C-043 and C-041.

---

## D-009 — Wave A0 is not dependency-free · 2026-08-05 · LOCKED

The earlier claim of a zero-dependency Wave A was inaccurate. Split:

- **A0** — genuinely independent branches.
- **A1** — C-020 (needs C-013), C-021 (needs C-015).

---

## D-010 — Wave E prompts are generated, not pre-written · 2026-08-05 · LOCKED

C-060 and C-061 are placeholders. They are not dispatchable until R-003 and R-004 deliver
exact findings, affected files, expected corrections and regression fixtures. Their prompt
bodies are generated *from* those reports.

## Open — not yet decided

| # | Question | Blocks | Why it cannot be answered from the repository |
|---|---|---|---|
| O-1 | `placeholder_backed_proteins` (21 in the pinned run): gold-set error class, or legitimate biology preservation? | any branch that touches protein export policy | It is a genuine disagreement between two intentional designs, not a defect. TRAP-3 forbids agents from resolving it. |
| O-2 | Should `runs_verify/*/cache_snapshot/` be gitignored? 8 dirs × 38 MB = 304 MB untracked; 16 such files are tracked in older `runs/`, none in recent `runs_verify/`. | INIT-001 evidence commit | Repository convention is genuinely mixed; committing or ignoring is a storage-policy call. |
| O-3 | Disposition of the 7 modified tracked scratch files, notably `data/enrichment_cache.json` (39 MB). | INIT-001 | Committing adds ~39 MB to a 158 MB `.git`; discarding loses cached lookups worth ~22 min per leg. |
